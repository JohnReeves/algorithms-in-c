#### Directory structure & progress chart

`NB:` repl.it has a bug that erases any templated folders.

* use `run` to execute main.sh;   
* modify `main.sh` to build & add linux features; or    
* use `gcc sample.c -o sample` to build your code.    
* navigate to `cd ./Results` and run with `./sample`
