# Algorithms in C
## by Robert Sedgewick

See the book for more information.

### Introduction

The objective of this book is to study a borad variety of important 
and useful Algorithms: methods for solving problems which are
suited for computer implementation.

### Outline of Topics

#### FUNDAMENTALS

The tools and methods used in the book: a short discussion of C; basic data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks,
queues and trees; the use of recursion; and analysing and implementing algorithms on a computer.


#### SORTING

Methods for arranging files in order, and related problems including priority queues, selectiona and merging. 

#### SEARCHING

Methods for finding things in files, using trees and digital key transformations; methods for large files; and similarities to sorting.

#### STRING PROCESSING

Methods for dealing with sequencies of characters, including: searching and pattern matching; parsing; compression; and cryptography.

#### GEOMETRIC ALGORITHMS

Methods for dealing with points and lines, and other geometric objects. 

#### GRAPH ALGORITHMS

Methods for dealing with connected objects, including: shortest paths; spanning trees; flow; and matching. 

#### MATHEMATICAL ALGORITHMS

Methods from arithmetic and numerical analysis, including: integers, polynomials and matrices; randmom number generation; simultaneous equations, data fitting and integration.

#### ADVANCED TOPICS 

Relates the methods from the other sections to advanced fields of study.
